/** Coding Idea
Create a program when it first prompts you to either if you want to log in to a product or ask if anything is expiring.
If you are logging in, you can type in the name of the product and the date you opened it, the good till this day date
If you ask, it will show you any product that is expiring within a span of one month.
To further make it better, ask if the product is expiring with this amount of months. */
